We have a [Roaring Bitmap organization on GitHub](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap) counting over 40 programmers. We
maintain a portable [format specification](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringFormatSpec).

* [RoaringBitmap](https://github.com/lemire/RoaringBitmap/) is a widely used, optimized and robust **Java** library. It supports both regular and off-heap (e.g., memory mapped) bitmaps.
* The [CRoaring library](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring) is a **C/C++** library that provides an optimized implementation of Roaring for C/C++ programmers. It works under Windows (Visual Studio), Linux (ARM and x64) and macOS.
  *   We have a[ **Python** library wrapping our C code](https://github.com/Ezibenroc/PyRoaringBitMap).
  *   We have a [**Rust** library wrapping our C code](https://github.com/saulius/croaring-rs).
  *   We have a [**Go** library wrapping our C code](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/gocroaring).    
  *   We have a [**C#** library wrapping our C code](https://github.com/RogueException/CRoaring.Net). It works under Windows and Linux.
* We have a pure [**Go** implementation of Roaring](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/roaring).
